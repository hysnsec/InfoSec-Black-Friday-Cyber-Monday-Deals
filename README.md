## Why Investing in Security Certifications Pays Off

Security jobs are splitting into specialized roles with better pay. Companies don't need generalists anymore. They require people who can secure AI systems from prompt injection, automate security across CI/CD pipelines, model threats in complex architectures, and defend Kubernetes clusters in production. 

These aren't nice-to-have skills. They're what separates $80K roles from $130K+ positions. Certifications prove you've done the work hands-on, not just watched videos. Upskilling now provides you with access to roles that didn't exist two years ago and leverage during salary negotiations that theory alone never will.
